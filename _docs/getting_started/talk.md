## Overview
A user's talk page is the way you can get in touch with other users on cyhoeddwn without exchanging email addresses. When you leave a message on a user's talk page, they'll get an email notification with your message embedded.

## Posting on a talk page
You can find a user's talk page by visiting their profile and clicking on the 'View talk page' button. On the page that loads, you will be able to leave a comment, as long as that comment is less than 500 characters. Posts are listed in reverse-chronological order, with the newest posts located at the top.
