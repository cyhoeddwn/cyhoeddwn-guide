On cyhoeddwn, you can create either a text-based post, or an image-based post with some free text. When displayed, image-based posts are shown with their media as large as possible with their free-text written beneath, whereas text-based posts will appear as an enlarged memo/index card. Both types of post will be explained here.

## Text only
**Prerequisites:** Text for something you'd like to share, subject to:

- Must be less than 140 characters
