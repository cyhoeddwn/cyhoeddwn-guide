# cyhoeddwn explained

## What is cyhoeddwn?
cyhoeddwn (kəhɔɨðʊn) is a web application used to manage content that can be displayed on connected nodes. A node is any device which can display content from the web in any modern web browser. cyhoeddwn is designed to be used in rural settings, but in practice could be used wherever required.

## Why does cyhoeddwn exist?
cyhoeddwn is kept in active development by [Genevieve Clifford](https://dev.becquerel.me). cyhoeddwn was created to fulfil part of the requirements of completing an MSc in Computer Science at Swansea University. This software and associated documentation forms part of the master's dissertation for this course (Designing Rural Pervasive Display Networks for Distributed and Democratic Governance) which was supervised by Stuart Nicholson.

This project builds on the previous study undertaken both by [Taylor et al.](http://www.nick-taylor.co.uk/research/wray/) and [Nicholson et al.](https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/showboater-insight-into-sustainable-rural-community-display-netwo), Taylor et al. bring the champion model to their networked display, Nicholson et al. seek to build further community engagement which ultimately became the champion model with time. In cyhoeddwn, it is hoped to reduce emotional and administrative burden in the ongoing running of the system by making community-at-large integration in the system inseparable from the day-to-day running of the application.
